# Linear Regression Assignment - Supervised Machine Learning (Coursera)

This repository contains my implementation of the **Linear Regression** Assignment from the [Supervised Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). The goal of this assignment is to implement **Linear Regression** from scratch and apply it to a dataset to predict outcomes based on input features.
