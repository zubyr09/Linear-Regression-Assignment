# Linear Regression Assignment - Supervised Machine Learning (Coursera)

This repository contains my implementation of the **Linear Regression** assignment from the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Supervised Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng on Coursera</a>. The goal of this assignment is to implement **Linear Regression** from scratch and apply it to a dataset to predict outcomes based on input features.

## Introduction
**Linear Regression** is a fundamental algorithm in Supervised machine learning used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (Target) and one or more independent variables (Features). This Assignment focuses on implementing **Linear Regression** with one variable from scratch using *NumPy* & & *Matplotlib* to predict profits for a **Restaurant Franchise**.

## Implementation
### Code File: `Linear_Regression_Code.ipynb`
The Jupyter Notebook [`Linear_Regression_Code.ipynb`](Linear_Regression_Code.ipynb) contains the full implementation of the assignment, including:
- Data preprocessing and visualization.
- Cost function and gradient descent implementation.
- Model training and evaluation.
- Visualizations of results.
